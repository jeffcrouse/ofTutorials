About this Documentation
------------------------

This documentation is generated with http://http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc[asciidoc]. If you want to re-generate any of the documentation, you'll need to install it. You'll also need http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/[source-highlight]. 

CAUTION: The most recent version of source-highlight at the time of this writing was 3.1.6, but I couldn't get this to compile on my Mac running 10.7.2. However, going back to ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/src-highlite/source-highlight-3.0.tar.gz[source-highlight-3.0] worked just fine.
